0,The_Thing,The_Thing_0,"""I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.""John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made  fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the ""dog"" is actually a shape-shifting alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims  in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison.""The Thing,"" the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic ""Alien"" (1979). Many comparisons have been made  the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However, ""The Thing""  for all practical purposes  came first.Based on the famous short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was ""The Thing From Another World,"" an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.
From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, ""The Thing""  by any standards  is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, ""The Thing"" performed poorly in theaters, and ""E.T.""  released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien  became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far).In the long run, however, ""The Thing"" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. ""The Thing,"" on the other hand, has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics  it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career  from his amazing ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (1976) to the magnificent ""Halloween"" (1978) to the disappointing and silly ""Escape from L.A."" (1996), ""The Thing"" remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most ""great movies"" lists, ""The Thing"" is still one of my favorite horror films, and  upon close inspection  masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling  a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs.

1,The_Thing,The_Thing_1,"A classic film. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of ""The Thing's"" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see ""The Thing"" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?""Trust is a tough thing to come by these days."" John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original.

2,The_Thing,The_Thing_2,"John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a ""what is in the shadow"" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it.

3,The_Thing,The_Thing_3,"""The ultimate in alien terror,"" it says. It's not wrong. This is it. This is the greatest horror film ever made. John Carpenter's A-#1.Cinema is full of great creature designs, yet The Thing bests them all. Every incarnation we see of the creature, and all the practical effects and set pieces that bring it to life, are the best that the industry has to offer. The most realistic CGI will never compete.The paranoia and distrust in the outpost is palpable. Carpenter crafts a tangible atmosphere of desperation and suspicion, from the unassuming beginning to the classic, ambiguous end--one of my very favorite endings from any movie, ever.Composer extraordinaire Ennio Morricone lends his great skills with a minimalist, synth-driven score that adds immensely to the building unease. It very well complements the performances of the excellent ensemble cast that bring every feeling of terror and wariness to life. Kurt Russell once again shines as Carpenter's lead, MacReady, and Keith David is superb as the antagonistic Childs. It's easy to overlook other cast members with smaller roles and less time on screen--even the unmistakable Wilford Brimley--but have no doubt, they're all just as good, just as essential to the picture.Once again: not only is John Carpenter a master storyteller, a fantastic director generally, but his greatest skill is in slowly building the tension and suspense in his pictures until the explosive finale. He does it so well that it's impossible for the viewer not to experience the same misgivings, the same sense of horror, as the characters on-screen--not because you're watching it, but because you FEEL it just as deeply.It's violent, it's gory, and broadly it may not be for everyone. But this needs to be seen by anyone with the slightest interest in horror, or creature features, or with a keen interest in cinema history as a whole.

4,The_Thing,The_Thing_4,"Remake of the classic 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette ""Who Goes There?"") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with ""E.T."" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film.

The Thing
Directed by: John Carpenter, 1982
Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.
Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.
It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story ""Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.
It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.
This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.
Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.
A satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity.
The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.
Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.
Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way.
The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).
Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.

With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast.

The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.

11,The_Thing,The_Thing_11,"Although this film clearly got made due to the success of ALIEN, I actually find it the better of the two. I certainly consider it Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy. This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story ""Who Goes There?"", which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting alien which consumes and imitates its prey – forget the T1000, he has nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting and disturbing and hard to forget – imagine some Lovecraftian terror in the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable body parts, and you're halfway there.The rest of the special effects are incredible; witness heads slide off bodies and turn into spiders, and the infamous and gut-wrenching kennel transformation which I had the misfortune to watch when I was but a boy. You can bet I had plenty of sleepless nights after watching that one. Plenty of blood, gore, and violence throughout make this one of the hardest of horrors. Yet despite all the effects, this is still a plot-driven movie with absolutely loads of suspense and tension – not to mention a near overwhelming paranoia throughout.There are many imaginative moments – the opening sequence, in which Norbert Weisser tries to kill a poor little doggie – to the excellent blood test scene, in which the guys are tied down whilst Russell tests their blood samples for the alien virus. Russell is subdued but great and as an ensemble, the rest of the guys are true to life and so believable, which makes it all the more horrific. Every outburst, crack-up or breakdown seems to be happening for real and we do learn to care about these very natural researchers trapped in the worst scenario imaginable. Add to this a spooky Morricone score and you have a super movie about which I can say no more – except that you watch it for yourself.",although clearly got made due success actually find better two certainly consider carpenter joint best along michael myers guy based campbell story goes also inspired flick another world saw james arness killer setting carpenter closer original story menace gory shape shifting consumes imitates prey forget nothing look creature extremely disgusting disturbing hard forget imagine lovecraftian terror flesh covered blood tentacles less describable body parts halfway rest special effects incredible witness heads slide bodies turn spiders infamous kennel transformation misfortune watch boy bet plenty sleepless nights watching plenty blood gore violence throughout make hardest horrors yet despite effects still absolutely loads suspense tension mention near overwhelming paranoia many imaginative moments opening sequence norbert weisser tries kill poor little doggie excellent blood test scene guys tied whilst russell tests blood samples virus russell subdued great ensemble rest guys true life believable makes horrific every outburst breakdown seems happening real learn care natural researchers trapped worst scenario imaginable add spooky morricone score super say except watch,2,0.8962,positive

Things get out of hand and the occupants of the chopper have their ability to pursue curtailed, more permanently than they'd like. Not too long after this carnage it becomes apparent that the pursuing shooters had a pretty good reason for wanting to remove the dog from the land of the living as the dog turns out to have the same aspirations as its pursuers, albeit in various guises, transformations, metamorphoses and reconfigurations.While this was made in 1981 it remains to this day one of the greatest and most engaging pieces of horror movie making that has ever been created.",stationed isolated outpost antarctica helicopter arrives intent shooting dog pursuing across tundra things get hand occupants chopper ability pursue curtailed permanently would like long carnage becomes apparent pursuing shooters pretty good reason wanting remove dog land living dog turns aspirations pursuers albeit various guises transformations metamorphoses made remains day greatest engaging pieces making ever created,2,0.9607,positive

Naturally, being a teen, I was reluctant to give anything from the 80s a try as I felt it to be a long gone ancient era. I was pleasantly surprised. The practical effects were a very welcome change to the cgi I was used to. They were done so well that I was at no point removed from the illusion. To this day, they're still the best I've seen. It's proof that if done right, practical effects such as animatronics will always beat out cgi.The movie is fantastic in every way. Kurt Russell is such a good actor that I'd have to class him as one of my favorites. Carpenter and Russell were a tour de force in the 80s creating both The Thing, and Escape From New York.",remember encouraged watch naturally teen reluctant give anything try felt long gone ancient era pleasantly surprised practical effects welcome change cgi used done well point removed illusion day still best seen proof done right practical effects animatronics always beat fantastic every way kurt russell good actor would class favorites carpenter russell tour de force creating escape new york,2,0.9776,positive
14,The_Thing,The_Thing_14,"In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien. And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.

To this day, very few other movies have shocked, haunted or unnerved me as much as The Thing. The scenery, sets and costumes are eye-popping and the effects are brilliantly designed and suitably grotesque without distracting too much.There is also Ennio Morricone's most haunting score, a cracking script and a deliberately slow-paced but compelling story that is quite ahead of its time.

17,The_Thing,The_Thing_17,"This movie failed at the box office and nearly ruined the career of John Carpenter. Think of that as you watch it. But did it really fail? It made nearly $20 million on a $15 million budget, but audiences must have expected more. Studios certainly did.Was it because E.T. came out at the same time, as well as so many other science fiction and fantasy films? Did the recession make people not want to watch something so nihilistic? Did the sheer level of gore turn people off? Were people upset that he remade a film some considered a classic*?After one market research screening, Carpenter asked the audience what they thought. One answered, ""Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?"" When Carpenter said that the answer was up to their imagination, the response was, ""Oh, God. I hate that.""How could audiences respond to a movie that did not spoon feed them any of the story beats? That doesn't have a single character to root for or get behind? That is influenced by Lovecraft - as our the other Apocalypse Trilogy installments Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness - in that ordinary people face off with supernatural horror that they are doomed to be destroyed by, which isn't really what mainstream America wants from a popcorn film?Yeah, it could be all of those things. Or perhaps, the world was not ready for it. But watching the end of this film, as everyone sits around wondering who has a disease that they can barely understand and know will eventually impact them, yeah. I think the world of 2020 is ready for it.I wonder what it's like to watch this movie when it screens every year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. I bet it feels pretty real there, too.In an interview with the AV Club, Carpenter said, ""If The Thing had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn't have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I'm not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making Christine and Starman and Big Trouble in Little China, all those films. But my career would have been different.""As it was, Carpenter was reluctant to make the film** and nearly quit before it ever started filming. A lifelong fan of Howard Hawks***, he felt that his version of the story - both are based on Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr. - was unbeatable. But as he re-read the original story - spurred on by co-producer Stuart Cohen - he saw how he could make a movie with a vision for his time, just as Hawks had thirty years ago.Beyond Carpenter, so many talents make this film work. Of course, there are the actors on screen, like Kurt Russell, Keith David, T.K. Carter, Wilfred Brimley, David Clennon and Richard Dysart. But there's also the astounding production design and storyboards from Man-Thing artist Mike Ploog and Mentor Huebner, which were so detailed that several of the shots from this look like carbon copies of their sketches. There's Dean Cundy working to make every shot look amazing - this is his first major studio movie with Carpenter. Want it to get even better? Sure, Carpenter could have done the score, but he got Ennio Morricone****. And finally, the Rob Bottin-lef effects team were pushed to the brink of exhaustion - Bottin was only 21 years old and ended up going to the hospital for exhaustion, double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer after working for an entire year on the film, sleeping on set - but the work they created will never be duplicated and puts any CGI efforts to remake this film to shame. Carpenter thought that having someone in a suit - like Alien - cheapened the film. He wanted something more. Well, he got it. In the last battle with the Thing, fifty different artists are operating the monster.We're lucky that this movie exists. I saw it at the drive-in this year and it felt like it could have been made today. It was too imaginative, too nihilistic and too good for most people, even nearly forty years later.*One of the reviews that upset Carpenter the most came from the co-director of the original, Christian Nyby, said, ""If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse. All in all, it's a terrific commercial for J&B Scotch.""**Originally, Universal was going with Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel as the team for this movie, but were unhappy with their take. John Landis was also considered, but the film was really greenlit when Alien was such a big deal in 1979.***How big of a fan is Carpenter? You can see scenes of The Thing from Another World during Halloween.****Morricone's score for this film was nominated for a Razzie, while his score for The Hateful Eight - which has some unused music from this film in it - won him his only Best Original Score Oscar.",failed box office nearly ruined career carpenter think watch really fail made nearly million million budget audiences must expected studios certainly came time well many science fiction fantasy recession make people want watch something nihilistic sheer level gore turn people people upset remade considered classic market research screening carpenter asked audience thought answered well happened end carpenter said answer imagination response oh god hate could audiences respond spoon feed story beats single character root get behind influenced lovecraft apocalypse trilogy installments prince darkness mouth madness ordinary people face supernatural doomed destroyed really mainstream america wants popcorn yeah could things perhaps world ready watching end everyone sits around wondering disease barely understand know eventually impact yeah think world ready wonder like watch screens every year south pole station bet feels pretty real interview av club carpenter said hit career would different would make choices made needed job saying hate movies loved making christine starman big trouble little china career would different carpenter reluctant make nearly quit ever started filming lifelong fan howard hawks felt version story based goes campbell unbeatable original story spurred stuart cohen saw could make vision time hawks thirty years carpenter many talents make work course actors screen like kurt russell keith david carter wilfred brimley david clennon richard dysart also astounding production design storyboards artist mike ploog mentor huebner detailed several shots look like carbon copies sketches dean cundy working make every shot look amazing first major studio carpenter want get even better sure carpenter could done score got ennio morricone finally rob effects team pushed brink exhaustion bottin years old ended going hospital exhaustion double pneumonia bleeding ulcer working entire year sleeping set work created never duplicated puts cgi efforts remake shame carpenter thought someone suit like cheapened wanted something well got last battle fifty different artists operating lucky exists saw year felt like could made today imaginative nihilistic good people even nearly forty years later reviews upset carpenter came original christian nyby said want blood go slaughterhouse terrific commercial j b scotch originally universal going tobe hooper kim henkel team unhappy take landis also considered really greenlit big deal big fan carpenter see scenes another world halloween morricone score nominated razzie score hateful eight unused music best original score oscar,0,0.9338,positive

20,The_Thing,The_Thing_20,"Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI, blue screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan of John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In 'The Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.
If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.

21,The_Thing,The_Thing_21,"The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares.

23,The_Thing,The_Thing_23,"A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking.

24,The_Thing,The_Thing_24,"If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, ""The Thing"" really gives ""Alien"" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider ""Starman"" to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike any""thing"" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how ""The Thing"" was doing on the IMDb scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now, it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason: It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that. Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in ""Predator"") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing, claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team, once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down, but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is nemesis for a horror movie and ""The Thing"" is living proof that if you plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.",reading comment feel assured people world share good taste favor watch immediately would probably best ever ridley scott masterpiece would say really gives run money talking cream crop category also easily qualifies best movies ever regardless genre carpenter master find pinnacle creative powers although consider starman even better another story performances cast across board screen writing stunning visuals cinematography course carpenter impeccable direction combine spellbinding nightmarish tale apocalypse unlike seen first checked see imdb scoreboard back disappointed see hovering somewhere comments good either exceptions pleased see gaining appreciation years see among top score good reason certainly greatest movies history went radar many years finally achieved cult status deserved first year old first watched late night tv perfect conditions age group watch like needless say scared death took long time watched way could remember key scenes sign profound impact kid right haunting title sequence think later also copied predator spectacular gore scenes chilling sense isolation impending doom created gloomy score since many many times admit perfect material repeated viewing quarter century first failed release witnessing quality supposed really puts shot today shame detail attention went production design truly amazing whole antarctic environment replicated tremendous accuracy feel cold isolation barren white wasteland story taking pivotal creating menacing claustrophobic atmosphere permeates start story quite unconventional based acclaimed novella team scientists stationed antarctica face life form found buried ice upon thawed ability consume living organisms including people imitate perfectly concentrates around fear mistrust communication breakdown ensues members team realize isolated outside world unable get help possibly human way dynamics team presented realistic depiction reactions makes transcend original premise become something much deeper profound always amazed realistic behavior member despite unrealistic setup see people afraid even break get regular unstable guy freaks tries kill everybody kurt russel gives performance rest cast also excellent job around terrific ensemble piece also large amount carefully timed quality gore utterly rob bottin man mainly responsible animatronic although also stan winston also involved animatronic work redefined state art possible producing best gore sequences ever remain unmatched even today effects really terrifying look feel real cgi nemesis living proof plan shoot even remotely scary scene make sure stick good old latex mention also go ennio moriccone haunting score believe actually nominated razzie morricone produced extremely effective underscore scenes communicating paranoia isolated team otherworldly presence lurks dark places waiting take recommend strongly rare combination unparalleled atmosphere unconventional story inspired visuals stood test time admirably,0,0.9976,positive

27,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_2,"Anyone who lives in the world and follows movies has a pretty good idea of the main concept behind a quiet place: there are beings that will kill you if you make a noise.
The film does very little to try to explain where these beings come from, all we know is how long they've been there for and that they have change the face of the planet in a pretty radical way.We follow the Abbot family, who lives in a remote country house with an elaborate system to keep each other safe, but the main thing is that they have become very skilled at being very quiet.The incredible result of that premise is that the film has very little dialogue and instead, makes great use of visuals and sound. And there are truly stunning set pieces in this film, and without spoiling anything, Emily Blunt gives a stellar performance, as usual. Frustratingly, because the film chooses to concentrate on the action and the premise, it failed to give real substance to its characters and their relationships. A very artificial conflict is created between the dad and his daughter, and it truly feels like it was added into a later version of the script to give some sort of emotional arc to the characters, but the result is clumsy at best, a bit ridiculous at worst.Additionally, the film fails to create very clear rules on what the creatures can and cannot hear, how they function, how they are able to detect obstacles in their path, how many there are, or how fast they move, are all animals dead, and the list probably goes on. The result is that whatever is established at one point inevitably changes later on to fit the dramatic needs of the story, but it undermines our ability to suspend disbelief. Repeatedly, it feels like the film is doing its best to thrill, even if that means going against the film's internal logic. On a similar note, around the middle of the film John Krasinski takes his son hunting. At some point, they stop by a waterfall, next to which Krasinski starts yelling, casually explaining to his son that as long as there is a louder sound next to them, they are absolutely safe. I was thinking the same thing during the first half of the film, namely - if these creatures follow sounds, then, wouldn't it be simple to constantly distract them with sounds everywhere? We certainly have the technology to do that. Also, shouldn't there be sound proof shelters? Couldn't all humanity focus on sound proofing all of their homes??But even if we accept for one second that these solutions are impossible, then, why not move next to a waterfall or any other natural place that is always very loud?? Plus, it doesn't look like they are able to shower at all, a waterfall would make a lot of sense hygiene wise.I understand that this is a movie and sometimes internal logic needs to be sacrificed, but this became a tough sell after that moment and it felt like the film did very little to address that glaring problem.",anyone lives world follows movies pretty good idea main concept behind beings kill make noise little try explain beings come know long change face planet pretty radical follow abbot family lives remote country house elaborate system keep safe main become skilled incredible result premise little dialogue instead makes great use visuals sound truly stunning set pieces without spoiling anything emily blunt gives stellar performance usual frustratingly chooses concentrate action premise failed give real substance characters relationships artificial conflict created dad daughter truly feels like added later version script give sort emotional arc characters result clumsy best bit ridiculous fails create clear rules creatures hear function able detect obstacles path many fast move animals dead list probably goes result whatever established point inevitably changes later fit dramatic needs story undermines ability suspend disbelief repeatedly feels like best thrill even means going internal logic similar note around middle krasinski takes son hunting point stop waterfall next krasinski starts yelling casually explaining son long louder sound next absolutely safe thinking first half namely creatures follow sounds would simple constantly distract sounds everywhere certainly technology also sound proof shelters could humanity focus sound proofing homes even accept second solutions impossible move next waterfall natural always loud plus look like able shower waterfall would make lot sense hygiene understand sometimes internal logic needs sacrificed became tough sell moment felt like little address glaring problem,0,0.9905,positive
28,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_3,"Well, I finally got around to watch the 2018 movie ""A Quiet Place"" here in 2021, since a lot of people have been telling me that the movie was oh so good and that I had been missing out on a great movie experience. Yeah, so I caved in and opted to sit down to watch director John Krasinski's 2018 movie.Sure, ""A Quiet Place"" was watchable, but it wasn't an outstanding movie experience for me. Why? Well, for several reasons actually.First of all, the movie's storyline and concept was just not overly impressive, nor something new or particularly innovative. It felt like something that had been done and seen before already.Then there was the thing with just too little was happening for about 55 minutes of the movie. And when things started to pick up, it was just not sufficient to make up for almost an hour wasted on essentially a heap of nothing filmed and showed in almost utter silence. Yeah, that was a swing and a miss for me.And then there were all the inconsistencies and flaws in the movie. I mean, if these creatures were attracted to sound, why wouldn't they be swarming at the creek where that sound was constantly being made from the running water, or congregating at the waterfall with all the noise that made. Or why would other creatures not be lured in by the noise of the one creature in the movie made, for example when it was assaulting the pickup truck or bursting through the corn silo? It just didn't make much of any sense. Or why would the family not have removed that nail in the wooden board or covered it up with something so no one would step on it? Seriously? And I suppose there were no condoms around in this kind of apocalyptic event. Seriously? You have established that the monsters are drawn to sound, heck, it was even shown in a newspaper in the movie, and still they opted to fornicate and bring a baby into that world. A baby! Babies cry and scream, if no one had bothered to inform them, despite the fact they had 3 kids before that newborn. And they also opted to grow a corn field, don't they know that a corn field is about as noisy as it gets when you move through it?Ugh, the movie was just not cutting it. And I seriously wanted to enjoy it and get into it, especially since a lot of my friends praised the movie to high heavens. I guess we just have very different tastes in movies and in what constitutes good entertainment.The movie has a relatively small ensemble of casted actors and actresses, but they did manage to put on good enough performances, despite having not that much dialogue.Visually then I will say that ""A Quiet Place"" was interesting. Why? Well, simply because of the creature design. I really liked that. So many nice details and an overall imposing and terrifying creature design. That definitely worked well in favor of the movie.I have part II lined up to watch as well, as my wife wants to watch it, but I can't really claim that I am in much of any hurry to watch it, nor harboring much of any hopes or expectations to the 2021 sequel.My rating of the 2018 ""A Quiet Place"" lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.

38,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_13,"""A Quiet Place"" directed by John Krasinski is a genuine and tensed horror/thriller. It has a unique premise and backstory. The setup for the story has been done well. The performances by John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the child actors is awesome. The direction of Krasinski is ""awesomer"". The tension and the thrills were genuinely great. That's something I have not seen in a horror/thriller for a long time. Speaking of horror, what we take as ""scary"" is totally subjective. If you're watching this to get some jumpscares or to see a ghost, this ain't your movie. There are many moments that give us the feeling of getting into the jaws of death, unexpectedly. Those were some real thrills. And, the characters know what's gonna kill them and why. So, whenever such things take place, the tension is amplified (no pun intended) and whether or not they are gonna succeed at the particular moment keeps you terrified. For me, anything that keeps you terrified is real horror than some ghosts and jumpscares, so I got my ""horror"" part in this movie, after a long time. It's not that it doesn't have any false scares, just one or two though. Whenever something goes wrong, you can feel the s**t happening. That's some incredible directing. It's just an awesome thrill ride until we reach the third act, where things just turn into the same old ""daddy loves you"" things and the final moments were a bit less satisfying for a thrill ride we witnessed for the majority of the movie. There are some notable plot holes regarding a ""better"" place they should've lived on, some sounds making no significance in the context of the movie's own rules, the way a lot of food, medicines don't get used up after such a long time, the crops being harvested (without any noise?) etc. The movie also shows certain stuff as if it was trying to say ""see this is a plot device, see see SEE!"" and it actually is so. One plotline with Emily Blunt and her ""youngest child"" was something that made no sense to be honest as per the movie's own rules and was obvious to play out in the later part of the movie. The way it was playing out was damn good, but we knew that something was up regarding this. That's all I can say and have to say about this movie, without spoiling anything. If you watch the movie, you'll know what I am pointing at. On the whole, I cannot overlook the flaws but man, I had a great time watching the movie. It's flawed but intriguing.

39,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_14,"I liked the concept of A Quiet Place but unsure about the execution with much of the blame lying with the script. Ironic as the film has very few lines.Directed and co-written by John Krasinski. The setting is a desolate post apocalyptic world. Earth has been invaded by monsters who are blind but have ultra sensitive hearing. Make a sound and you are dead, ripped apart by an alien.Living in a remote farmhouse, a family does their best to survive but they have lost one child already. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) have set up their lives to survive this vicious world for their deaf daughter, Regan and young son Marcus. However Evelyn has become pregnant and is about to give birth to a baby and that baby is going to make noise.The film left me uneasy at the beginning as one young child walks single file at the back, with both the adults way ahead at the front. It did not look like sensible risk management to me and so it proved. This is a film that easily falls apart if you examine it carefully.However as a horror thriller, Krasinski makes it work to an extent. It is different and eerie with a lack of noise.

41,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_16,"'A Quiet Place' very quickly became one of my most anticipated films of the year. Have liked Emily Blunt a lot in other things, have a lot of appreciation for the genre and absolutely adored the concept. One of the year's best concepts and one of the most brilliant and unique for any film. Seeing it, 'A Quiet Place' turned out to be one of my favourites of the year too, its positive critical reception more than deserved. Can understand though if it doesn't work for others, it is not a film that everybody will enjoy with its deliberate pace, very sparse use of music and dialogue and heavy reliance on atmosphere. Have seen many films recently that have wasted good potential and ideas or not quite fulfilling them. So it was refreshing and a blessing to have such a brilliant and unique concept executed in a way that was equally brilliant and as a film unlike any other seen by me. Was far too transfixed by the atmosphere and mood to criticise 'A Quiet Place' for lack of logic, plot holes (have never criticised a film for plot holes, find it a lazy and unfair criticism especially when it's the only thing mentioned in reviews that list them and say nothing about the film's overall quality) or not making complete sense. When a film doesn't transfix or engage me it is less forgivable, but 'A Quiet Place' was utterly transfixing from start to finish from personal view. It's a beautifully made film with a lot of style and atmosphere. Not everybody will like that the use of dialogue and music is sparse. That wasn't a problem for me, in fact it was appreciated and it worked really well. Actually think it was the right thing to do. Without constant music, the concept and atmosphere came through stronger, if the music was intrusive, obvious or repetitive they would not have worked anywhere near as well. Without constant dialogue, it let the actors' expressions and body language do all the talking, have seen horror/sci-fi films, and films in general actually, recently that have suffered from too much talk and exposition that it bogs the pace down and it's even more of a problem when the dialogue isn't good or interesting. Appreciated hugely that 'A Quiet Place' didn't go down that route.Luckily the acting benefits from having little dialogue, here it's a masterclass of expressions speaking louder than words. Emily Blunt is simply sensational in a very moving and expressive performance that is among her best. Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe also impress in beyond their years performances that one doesn't actually expect from actors so young. So does John Krasinki in a performance just as expressive, in a subtle way, and charismatic. In the director's chair, he shows a lot of confidence and great talent for mood and storytelling. Especially good about 'A Quiet Place' is the atmosphere, which smoulders from every frame and shapes every part of the story. The pace is a deliberate slow-burn but for me it was never dull. Parts of 'A Quiet Place' are heartfelt, others are quirky. But above all it's genuinely scary and unnerving, enhanced by tremendous use of sound design that generates unbearable tension. The monsters are incredibly nightmarish, actually takes a lot for me to feel unsettled after watching a film since getting older, 'A Quiet Place' did that for me.Overall, a superb film and one of my favourites of the year so far. 10/10 Bethany Cox",quickly became anticipated year liked emily blunt lot things lot appreciation genre absolutely adored concept year best concepts brilliant unique seeing turned favourites year positive critical reception deserved understand though work others everybody enjoy deliberate pace sparse use music dialogue heavy reliance atmosphere seen many recently wasted good potential ideas quite fulfilling refreshing blessing brilliant unique concept executed way equally brilliant unlike seen far transfixed atmosphere mood criticise lack logic plot holes never criticised plot holes find lazy unfair criticism especially mentioned reviews list say nothing overall quality making complete sense transfix engage less forgivable utterly transfixing start finish personal view beautifully made lot style atmosphere everybody like use dialogue music sparse problem fact appreciated worked really well actually think right without constant music concept atmosphere came stronger music intrusive obvious repetitive would worked anywhere near well without constant dialogue let actors expressions body language talking seen general actually recently suffered much talk exposition bogs pace even problem dialogue good interesting appreciated hugely go acting benefits little dialogue masterclass expressions speaking louder words emily blunt simply sensational moving expressive performance among best millicent simmonds noah jupe also impress beyond years performances actually expect actors young krasinki performance expressive subtle way charismatic director chair shows lot confidence great talent mood storytelling especially good atmosphere smoulders every frame shapes every part story pace deliberate never dull parts heartfelt others quirky genuinely scary unnerving enhanced tremendous use sound design generates unbearable tension monsters incredibly nightmarish actually takes lot feel unsettled watching since getting older superb favourites year far bethany cox,0,0.9965,positive
42,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_17,"This film is a classic case of ""we just have to make a film about that premise"", however what the people involved didn't do well is figure out how to cover all the plot holes the premise was always going to introduce.The introduction is moving and sets up the premise well, however I started to realise the lack of care that would be taken later in the film when I realised that I was being asked to believe that a four-year-old (left to walk by himself at the rear of a family in a dangerous situation) could get two batteries inserted in a toy. Even if the kid could do it, the chances would be only one in four of getting the batteries oriented correctly. Why didn't the creature come back to hunt the father based on the sound of his running footsteps?So it's possible to kill the creatures with a gun? Okay, then ... with gun ownership in the US being about one per capita, surely the creatures would have been wiped out long ago by having provided the population with the target practice they must secretly crave?So a family with kids survived whatever (unexplained) apocalypse occurred prior to the film's beginning, but the army didn't?So the creatures have no vision and super-sensitive hearing? What about a sense of smell?So no one talks in their sleep or snores (or has farts)? Do toilets flush?So the creatures can rip though a metal grain silo, but not instantly get into a truck to get at the two kids inside? And out of interest, how do you harvest a field of corn without making a sound? How do you remove the kernels of corn from the cobs and get them into the silo?So they have to play Monopoly with crocheted pieces (to avoid noise), but the sound of a truck rolling down a hillside is okay?I think that would be shortest labour in history. I'm pretty sure the timeline in the movie is continuous enough to prove that she only had three or four contractions. None of that annoying 30-hour stuff for her!Would the hearing aid really have broadcast with enough power in the right frequencies to affect the creatures that much? Would those frequencies have been reproduced by the microphone system? Who knows? Perhaps. To be honest, I find the similar resolution based on the playing of Slim Whitman's ""Indian Love Call"" in the film ""Mars Attacks!"" to be almost as believable.Why not spend most of your time living behind the waterfall? Why not set up a remote-control noise maker on the lawn and set up position on the porch with a shotgun? And I'm sure that I'm only scratching the surface when it comes to solutions.And there were too many horror-movie clichés: intensely irritating sounds at crucial moments and terror originating just outside of shots tightly centered on actors.The cocking of a shotgun just prior to the credits screams sequel.

They look and act like violent creatures with only one purpose to kill everything that makes noise, how would that attitude and intellect allow for interstellar travel? how does a shot gun to the head kill it if it's indestructible, come on now we have weapons on earth that would crush these things in seconds. of course ultrasonic sound is gonna freak it out if small sound attracts it, it really takes over a year to figure that out? where's the beginning ?

A box? they could have lived by the waterfall if they could scream by it. lastly everything on this planet makes noise, trees falling in the woods, rain on the ground, the damn wind.

44,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_19,"This film was a huge disappointment. My expectations were high based on the Rotten Tomato User scores, I do not pay much attention to the industry professional critics scores so I ignore the regular Rotten Tomato Score and the Metacritic equivalent. I usually go by the audience score instead.The movie has no backstory to tell us what happened. The story is completely illogical. It makes no sense why the characters do what they do. Why would Regan give her little brother a toy shuttle that makes noises when she took it away in the first place. I knew what would happen before Beau (the little boy) took the batteries back from the countertop.How did the Abbott's managed to cover so many trails with Sand?Why would Mrs. Evelyn Abbott get pregnant and put the entire family in jeopardy. Did they think through what would go on during labor? And where they under the impression they could command a newborn to be quiet upon demand?The film was not remotely suspenseful because their actions made it very clear what the consequences would be. The film was utterly predictable. Besides, most of the film is silent until a few seconds before an event is going to happen and then the soundtrack gives it away. Why are the characters consistently shushing each other throughout the movie? Haven't they all lived like that since the invasion? On jump scares, this film fails miserably. Here is the glaring problem I had with this film. They knew the creatures were sensitive to sound, then why not ambush the creatures and pick them off with guns. Here is an idea. Place loudspeakers on the nozzle of an Abrams M1 Tank's canon and have fun splattering alien juice all over the place.Forget about buying snacks to eat while watching the movie.

46,A_Quiet_Place,A_Quiet_Place_21,"This is a boring hour and a half of a family trying to be quiet. I didn't care about whether anyone survived because all they did was behave stupidly the entire show. The premise was preposterous, there was no attention given to how the apocalypse occured, how these sightless monsters decimated human life, eliminated standing armies, etc.We're supposed to believe this family got by with whispering. Yet, somehow they managed to procure a million sacks of white sand and deliver it and use it to cover miles and miles of paths without making a sound? They got that done and the only weapon they scraped up in the meantime was one shotgun?Then, somehow, without any humans to operate it, the power grid is totally up and running. And without any worries about that, the family runs hundreds of electric bulbs, even outdoors, red bulbs no less for no apparent reason other than to look good on screen.Yet when it comes to their sound proof room, with no ventilation, they don't even bother to run an extension cord in to operate a single bulb. They instead burn candles to make their lives an even worse living hell with smoke in an almost airtight enclosed space.Shall we discuss the ridiculous silo scene? The kids fall into dried field corn kernels and sink into it like its quicksand. What??? Then, somehow the silo roof door falls off its incredibly strong hinges, so they can use it as a raft to escape the quicksand effect. Then, right after they escape the supposed corn quicksand by clambering on to the fallen door, a monster scratches its way thru the solid steel wall of the silo in like two seconds and attacks the kids. What do they do? They clamber under the door for protection. Do they sink into the corn now? Of course not, corn isn't quicksand the second time. Everyone knows that. So, the monster moves on the kids basically walk across the corn and escape.🙄In another scene there's a broken water pipe that floods the entire basement with a foot of water. A monster is face to face with Blunt but cannot hear her so she survives. Ten minutes later that flooded room is dry as a bone and with no explanation the broken pipe was ever repaired so it is irrelevant.The deaf daughter is one of the least likely individuals to survive. She wouldn't be able to hear if she was making noise, so she would be picked off first. And then the idea that she would be the one to discover the hearing aid feedback loop is laughable.Then the whole baby business. Give me a break. And how is the corn being planted? Or harvested? They never seem to eat, but its obvious they would be surviving on canned goods. How do they open all the cans silently?Then Krasinsky commits ""suicide by monster"" to save his kids, instead of doing any simple thing other than yelling and standing still. He could just toss the axe ten feet away and not die. So he dies, stupidly, which accomplishes nothing because the kids don't escape.Then the final scene where Emily Blunt takes FOREVER to shoot the monster in the head with a shotgun, killing it with one shot... Leaving us to wonder how these creatures destroyed every military-industrial complex on the planet.To make matters worse, Emily Blunt has lost her husband and at least one child in the last 24 hours, given birth in a bathtub, and she's all 'lock and load' attitude with her shotgun to end the film.I could literally list another hundred idiotic things in this movie, but I don't feel that I should spend more time on my critique than the writers spent on the lazy script.If you want to watch a movie about people being hunted by sightless monsters, see any of the Tremors movies. At least those films are fun.If you want to see weird noises disable aliens, watch the wonderful Twilight Zone episode from 1962 where Andy Devine plays the character Frisby and escapes due to his harmonica.Back to this trainwreck A Quiet Place.

There are a lot of things I did not like about this movie. The main one is what my title suggests, lots of stupid, bad decisions.1. Why would the girl give that toy to the kid? Clearly the dangers around them are not made aware to them. (this will be a theme)
2. Why are the parents already out the door and gone? They just watched this kid making horrible mistakes that could get them all killed and then they just turn their back on him. Don't get it.
3. Why, if walking single file, would you have your 4 year old bringing up the rear? Dad should be in the rear so as to watch the whole family. 
4. Clearly this 4 year old was not made aware of the actual dangers around them. Bad idea kid. 
Only 5 minutes into the movie so far.
5. Why would a woman allow herself to get pregant in a situation like that? Clearly the dangers have not been made clear.
6. Why is a child who is deaf not under a little more control? Just for the benefit of herself and all around her? Clearly the dangers have not been made clear.
7. Why does dad and son go for food so close to her having the baby? You would think he would have been prepared so as not to have to be gone during this time. Clearly the dangers around them are not clear.
8. Why are they sealing the entrance underground with a mattress? This is the best you have? With all the other stuff they have done around there I would have expected them to be underground more. And with more than just a mattress for a ""door"". 
9. Why not live near the river/waterfall so noises you make around the house won't be heard as much? 
10. Why are the kids using a lantern? They have electricity. And why do you let kids sit that close to a lantern on the floor? Clearly the dangers around them have not been made clear.
11. Why show all the other people lighting their signal fires just to not mention them in any other scene for any reason at all? 
12. Why was the scene with the old man so stupid?
13. Why show that creepy old house if not including any other scenes explaining it?
14. Why was the top of the babies crib off? How did that happen?
15. Why did the dad not just be quiet when he realized the creature was above him? They all move about without being heard all the time so why now?

He shows some skill here with ""A Quiet Place,"" but, like Peele, I can't help but feel a little disappointed with his work given the high praise from critics and the commercial success. ""A Quiet Place"" showcases a truly brilliant concept, some effective moments of tension and emotion, but undercuts it with some serious bs writing, a dumb ending, and lack of true terror.A lot can be said about the concept of ""A Quiet Place."" When I first heard of this movie I was immediately sold. The concept is very original and quite brilliant: monsters that hunt by sound. One small noise could mean your end. ""A Quiet Place"" delivers on some serious tense moments and even a few emotional shockwaves. The story is never boring and director John Krasinski is able to hold the audiences' attention throughout the short runtime, even more impressively done without the aid of dialogue. The performances were all believable and everyone did a good job acting scared s**tless. However, some of the writing was shoddy.*Spoilers* There are many moments when the monsters should have killed members of the family. When Emily Blunt gives birth without medical assistance while making no sounds at all (even from the freakin' newborn baby) as a monster is literally 10 feet from her is ridiculous and laughably bad. Better yet, she should have died when she was in the water bound basement with the monster swimming beneath her. There were five different times the kids should have died but the monsters were probably too lazy or dumb to kill them (the barn, the truck, the cornfield). Why did that idiot five-year-old not understand you can't make sounds? This is even dumber given he died on Day 89, meaning this idiot survived that long. BS! And worst of all the monsters' weakness was dumber than the aliens from ""Signs"" (but I actually liked ""Signs""). All they had to do was play a queef frequency on a girl's hearing aid and then shotgun the monsters in the head. Wow, funny how no one else figured that out. I called bs on so many things I couldn't get as emotionally involved as I wanted too nor could I suspend my disbelief for proper enjoyment.""A Quiet Place"" delivered on what the trailer promised minus actual horror or any real intelligence. Never during the film's runtime did I actually feel scared, I did jump, but good horror movies should scare you, not make you just jump. Though most movies nowadays don't scare people, especially people who are old cynical a**holes like me. Post Apocalyptic creature features don't scare me but some can gross me out like the hugely underrated ""The Mist."" I tend to soil myself over ghostly haunted house movies because now that is scary.

52,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_2,"It seems that in 'Alien: Covenant', Ridley Scott and his writers tried to use the best loved elements from previous Alien installments to appease those fans of the franchise who hated 'Prometheus' - but perhaps also to camouflage their intention to make a far meaner and less conventional blockbuster than what modern audiences (and studios) are willing to accept in this age of superheroes. It was my impression that what on the surface appears to be a very straight forward - and some might even say derivative - retread of familiar story beats is actually just a ploy to delve even deeper into the themes explored in 'Prometheus'. Because 'Alien: Covenant' not only continues to ""dissect"" the creator/creation/creature dynamic: it brings the android David's storyline to its perverse, if somewhat logical, conclusion.Now if you hated 'Prometheus', or just dismissed it as a dumb movie where most characters are stupid and nothing is explained or makes sense, you won't find much to like in the less conventional story elements in 'Alien: Covenant', and you might as well stop reading this review now (btw, if you still have questions about 'Prometheus', you'll find a link to an article explaining everything by clicking on my username). But if you DID like it - or at least found its maliciously ironic religious subtext and musings on creation fascinating - you'll probably find some aspects of 'Alien: Covenant' highly enjoyable. As you might recall, the cycle of creation depicted in 'Prometheus' goes as follows: the Gods (aka ""the Engineers"") create mankind - mankind creates David - David in turn starts to experiment on his creators (the humans) in order to create something new.The totally insane - and hilariously mean spirited - continuation/escalation of that cycle in 'Alien: Covenant' (beware: spoilers abound for the whole movie follow): David's ambition to make the jump from creation to creator has grown exponentially; it now entails nothing less than to exterminate the Gods, as well as experimenting on them - which makes him kind of hard to top in the mad scientist (or mad killer robot) department. By killing the Gods, he, the unworthy machine and ""2nd class"" creation conquers ""Paradise/Heaven"" and becomes the sole creator (humans are degraded to the status of lab-rats), thereby closing the cycle started in 'Prometheus'.Admittedly, the film is uneven in terms of story and pacing - but I admire its ambition. 'Alien: Covenant' is a fascinating hybrid which somehow halfway through its running time turns from relatively straight sci-fi and very familiar Alien terrain into a brooding, Gothic horror film (at least for a while before it turns back into a more conventional sci-fi/action film). In the Gothic part of the film, the man-made monster/creature (David) has turned the table and assumed the role of Dr. Frankenstein to make creatures of his own design. These creatures - who appear to be the first actual Xenomorphs - reflect and reveal who/what David really is and how deceiving his human looks are. For although he inherited some very human traits from his creator (emotions, curiosity, ego, the urge to create - among others) he is still a machine adhering to a logic that is ultimately as alien (pun intended) to a human being as the Xenomorph itself - and as lethal. Which is why it makes complete sense that David is the ""designer"" of this perfect, machine-like organism (Swiss artist H.R. Giger, who created the original Alien, called it ""biomechanoid"" for a reason).In 'Alien: Covenant', David is the humans' - and humanity's - ultimate adversary; in fact, for the purpose of the story told in the film, he is the Devil (he even quotes Satan's famous lines from John Milton's epic poem 'Paradise Lost'). Now if the Devil in this tale were to create life in HIS own image (his REAL image - for David was only given human features to make interaction with him more ""comfortable"" for the humans), surely, he would create demons: and isn't the Xenomorph the ultimate demon sprung straight from the darkest pits of Hell? That 'Alien: Covenant' is essentially a riff on Milton's 'Paradise Lost' was the most surprising aspect of the film for me. David's story-line follows Satan's (quite literal) ascent to Heaven (Paradise), where he kills the Gods and starts his own rule, thus turning it into Hell and ending the age of man (and for those of you who think I'm reaching a little here: the film's title was originally supposed to be 'Alien: Paradise Lost'). Now regardless whether you liked the film or not, you have to admit: that's not exactly the texture of a generic, conventional blockbuster, right?At the end of the film, David is aboard the spaceship Covenant - which he has turned into a perverted version of Noah's Arch - and travels to a new world where he plans to start his new version of Genesis. He might even start a new religion: the Bible as written by a mad killer robot with a god complex (just think about how crazy demented - and completely wonderful - that sounds). Imagine the Lovecraftian nightmare he will create and what creatures will populate ""his"" version of Earth. I would love a sequel to 'Alien: Covenant' to take us there and finally fully descend into madness. It would be the logical next step: after the human protagonists visited an angry god in 'Prometheus' who wanted to destroy humanity, and then discover that Heaven is empty and the Gods are all dead in 'Alien: Covenant', they should next visit the Devil in his newly created Hell. My suggestion for a title: 'Alien: Genesis'.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",seems ridley scott writers tried use best loved elements previous installments appease fans franchise hated perhaps also camouflage intention make far meaner less conventional blockbuster modern audiences studios willing accept age superheroes impression surface appears straight forward might even say derivative retread familiar story beats actually ploy delve even deeper themes explored continues dissect dynamic brings android david storyline perverse somewhat logical hated dismissed dumb characters stupid nothing explained makes sense find much like less conventional story elements might well stop reading review way still questions find link article explaining everything clicking username like least found maliciously ironic religious subtext musings creation fascinating probably find aspects highly enjoyable might recall cycle creation depicted goes follows gods aka engineers create mankind mankind creates david david turn starts experiment creators humans order create something totally insane hilariously mean spirited cycle beware spoilers abound whole follow david ambition make jump creation creator grown exponentially entails nothing less exterminate gods well experimenting makes kind hard top mad scientist mad killer robot department killing gods unworthy machine class creation conquers becomes sole creator humans degraded status thereby closing cycle started uneven terms story pacing admire ambition fascinating hybrid somehow halfway running time turns relatively straight familiar terrain brooding gothic least turns back conventional gothic part david turned table assumed role frankenstein make creatures design creatures appear first actual xenomorphs reflect reveal david really deceiving human looks although inherited human traits creator emotions curiosity ego urge create among others still machine adhering logic ultimately pun intended human xenomorph lethal makes complete sense david designer perfect organism swiss artist giger created original called biomechanoid reason david humans humanity ultimate adversary fact purpose story told devil even quotes satan famous lines milton epic poem lost devil tale create life image real image david given human features make interaction comfortable humans surely would create demons xenomorph ultimate demon sprung straight darkest pits hell essentially riff milton lost surprising aspect david follows satan quite literal ascent heaven paradise kills gods starts rule thus turning hell ending age man think reaching little title originally supposed paradise lost regardless whether liked admit exactly texture generic conventional blockbuster right end david aboard spaceship turned perverted version noah arch travels new world plans start new version genesis might even start new religion bible written mad killer robot god complex think crazy demented completely wonderful sounds imagine lovecraftian nightmare create creatures populate version earth would love sequel take us finally fully descend madness would logical next step human protagonists visited angry god wanted destroy humanity discover heaven empty gods dead next visit devil newly created hell suggestion title masterpieces reviewed,0,0.9936,positive
53,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_3,"So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole ""let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead"" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be ""safe""? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* ""twist"" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.A generous 2 Stars.

56,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_6,"This was dumb.The crew of the spaceship, Covenant, is transporting 2,000 colonists to a new solar system, but their journey is interrupted by a solar flash which damages the ship. While making repairs, they pick-up a signal from a previously uncharted planet. Upon locating it and determining it can support human life, the captain (Billy Crudup) makes a spur of the moment decision to chuck aside all the planning that was put into their expedition to make this new planet their colonial destination. He gets some slight push-back about this flippant decision from his second-in-command, ""Daniels"" (Katherine Waterston who looks eerily like her father), but that seems to be the only complaint.So, the crew set down on this planet with no real plan, no protective gear, and just start winging it with, of course, disastrous results because this is an ""Alien"" movie.The crew, especially the captain, appear to have the intelligence of turnips.

For him to go forward with this stupid story with all its plot holes that require characters to repeatedly act like irrational fools is sad.

59,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_9,"'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film. 'Alien 3' and 'Resurrection' had their issues but to me weren't that bad, while 'Prometheus' had some fine elements while also some major flaws.My thoughts on 'Alien: Covenant' is fairly similar to my ones on 'Prometheus'. Not as bad as led to believe (having read reviews that were mostly mixed to negative), but could have been much better considering the brilliance of 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. With a good cast, and with the involvement of a hit and miss but talented (especially visually) director Ridley Scott, 'Alien: Covenant' could and should have been far better. Some undeniable strengths here, at the same 'Alien: Covenant' also commits the same faults as 'Prometheus', and makes even more of the mistake of having little point to it other than providing a few necessary answers to loose ends from 'Prometheus'.Lets start with 'Alien: Covenant's' strengths. Even when the writing and story weren't up to snuff, Scott's films always looked visually beautiful. 'Alien: Covenant' is not an exception. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and is often powerfully arresting and most of the special effects (apart from the disappointingly cheap-looking ones for the xenomorph) are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.Jed Kurzel's music score is hauntingly unsettling and recalls one fondly of the music in the original film by Jerry Goldsmith. There are a few scary moments (though this doesn't come consistently) and credit is due for providing much needed answers to questions that were on people's lips after watching 'Prometheus'.Of a pretty good cast, considering what they had to work with, Michael Fassbender's commandingly and intensely acted dual role is the standout. Katherine Waterston brings steel and vulnerability, yet another performance demonstrating why she is one to watch, and surprisingly Danny McBride succeeds in trying to fully form his character rather than be annoying or looking stoned. Billy Crudup also tries his best with little to do.However, genuine tension and suspense is replaced by monster/alien action and attempts at character motivations. Sadly too much of the monster/alien action is not that exciting and only sporadically scary, cheapened by at times excessive and gratuitous gore (by far the goriest and bloodiest of the 'Alien' franchise and the approach felt a little out of place). On top of that the characters (in a film where there is too many of them in the first place) are very thinly sketched rather than fully formed and of the lot only Tennessee, Walter and David properly raise above forgettable, David especially being pretty splendidly drawn actually. The constant frustrating decision making from most of the characters also prevents one from properly connecting to them.Script is also often very weak, even more rambling and cliché ridden than that of 'Prometheus', with philosophising and thrown in references to the likes of Wagner and Michaelangelo that gives a sense that the film wasn't sure of its identity. The story suffers from dull pacing and from being over-stuffed of too many ideas not done enough with. By the time the big reveal came it leaves one with a so what feel, due to it being so obvious too early on, and there is far too much of a you have seen it all before vibe.In conclusion, tries hard and there's no doubting that a lot of work went into the visual aesthetics and the acting but 'Alien: Covenant' should have been much more.

It felt sharp, atmospheric, there are interesting character situations, emotive moments and infinitely better writing than we had in Prometheus. As it progresses, this feeling continues - thankfully, a solid sci-fi film that got it right. Then Ridley starts to indulge in his convoluted ideas about creation and destruction. Its like switching from 1977 George Lucas to 1999 Lucas. You can almost hear Ridley at a writing meeting saying ""this'll be cool, and this, and this, and then this"" and the writer saying ""uh, is this for the same film or later in the series?"" ""Yeah just cram it all in, make it happen"". You end up with three different films - a first act like a modern Alien which I loved, a middle act of Prometheus style philosophizing that feels like more Westworld, then a last act of two shoe-horned in action scenes homaging Aliens and Alien 3 respectively. Except there is no satisfaction at all, because the aliens are rushed, a bit silly, often awkwardly CGI looking, and not even convincing as threats because we don't care about any of it. By the end I just have no idea what to think.

64,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_14,"Alien: Covenant (2017)** (out of 4)Sequel to PROMETHEUS and a connection to the ALIEN series, this sci-fi film has a spaceship trying to locate a planet so that the human race can continue. The crew are planning on building a colony but they notice a much closer planet that can hold life. They decide to head there to see what's on it and soon the horror starts.To put it mildly, ALIEN: COVENANT is a major disappointment. It seems a lot of fans were unhappy with PROMETHEUS because it was more of a thinking man's movie and less of a action/horror/sci-fi film. It seems that this film was in trouble from the start because you have to wonder if there was some sort of debate before hand on what should be done with it. PROMETHEUS was a terrific movie that made you think about a lot of things but sadly this sequel doesn't do that. Instead, it almost seems as the filmmakers were forced to answer a few questions about PROMETHEUS and then they wanted to throw in the action of an ALIEN sequel.What really shocked me about this movie is the fact that it almost put me to sleep several times. I'm not going to say that the film is a cure for insomnia but at the same time it's deadly slow at times even though there's usually something always going on. As I said, the screenplay doesn't seem to know what the film should do and the majority of the running time is just downright boring. The film starts off with a tragedy yet it's hard to have any emotions for the characters because we're just getting to know them. Another problem is the fact that the characters are all rather bland with the exception of Michael Fassbender's two-part role.As I said, I thought the characters were rather boring and I'd argue that not many of the performances are all that memorable. Perhaps a longer director's cut will eventually show up but there's really not too much here. Fassbender delivers a fine performance but I can't say I was impressed with the rest of the cast. On a technical level Ridley Scott is a visual genius so all of that stuff looks great. There's some extremely gory scenes of violence, which are very good but the film is just way too uneven to work.It's like part of the movie wanted to be another thinking man's movie but there's another part that wanted to be a bloody action film.

Imagine if someone picked a talentless, autistic nerd, told him to write and direct a fan fiction film, and gave him a professional film crew to get it done. This is that film. It is so badly written that it boggles the mind. It doesn't care about the story, the characters, or even the action. It's as though it goes through the motions, hoping to get to the end as quickly as possible, while never stopping to pay attention to anything. It has no rhythm, no buildup of suspense, no memorable characters or scenes, and it leaves a strong impression of being made by people who really don't care about anything except getting the whole thing finished and shipped to the cinemas worldwide.I guess I can give it one star instead of zero for comedic value: people repeatedly slipping on blood (absolutely hilarious), the dancing alien from Spaceballs, the 'put your head in the egg' moment (remember Blackadder and the Scotsman that puts his head in the cannon?), the whole talk about 'security protocols' while no one even wears a protection suit on an alien planet, the silly 'good vs. evil Data' thing that was done a lot better in a much cheaper Star Trek episode...

68,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_18,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen!Prometheus may have been a colossal clusterfudge and absolutely cursed to the marrow on every conceivable level, but at the very, very least it had the moxie to ask big questions even if no one and nothing within had the ability to answer back with anything remotely resembling logic or sense. Ridley Scott didn't seem to understand the logic and mythology of the universe he created and if you think he's going to retcon himself back on track with this pile of crap you'll be making the same mistake as me.I knew that he had painted himself into a corner. If they followed the David/Shaw storyline and went to the Engineer homeworld (they are still the stupidest-looking creature design in film history) then every single part of the dialogue would have to be delivered by just two characters. So now we have a NEW ship with a NEW heavy- handed symbolic name filled with NEW fresh, disposable meat...I mean characters heading out into space under the banner of Weyland Corp.After sustaining some damage from a solar flare or whatnot the crew pick up a transmission from a nearby planet and decide to go check it out. So far so very familiar. When they get down there they discover a crashed derelict ship. Okay, I've DEFINITELY seen this before. And then...all Alien hell breaks loose, but not before a long, seemingly endless succession of scenes where people loudly discuss the plot in a way that would make the earliest Scooby-Doo episodes look like masterpiece theatre.This is complete garbage, kiddies. There is a line of dialogue between David and Walter where Mad Dave actually says the words ""You hold it and I'll do the fingering."" Yes, he's talking about playing a flute but COME ON!!! How in heaven or hell did THAT go unnoticed? Was anyone paying attention to how terrible this is?We don't even get the classic Xenomorph, but instead have to be content with a Neomorph/Protomorph/Morph/Sooty and Sweep/Howdy Doody placeholder. The Protomorph CGI is frequently terrible too and looks like something from a video game.Ridley Scott succeeds, again, at making this look like a genuine, lived-in universe, but the characters are never anything more than fodder and even at 122 minutes you can tell a LOT was cut out of this. They clearly struggle to find a workable pacing in this theatrical cut and it feels sloppily edited throughout. The final 20 minutes seems like a completely different movie and lowers itself to the tone of a Friday the 13th film. Nothing against Jason Voorhees, but the Alien series is supposed to be more cerebral and Covenant is so lame that you'll actually be longing for the comfort of Alien: Resurrection or AVP: Requiem.Alien didn't need a prequel. A huge part of the lure was the darkness, the mystery, the coincidence, the infinite unknown. To have it all explained by Prometheus was a bad idea, but that movie completely failed to even come anywhere close to that. Covenant should have spent its running time answering questions Prometheus dumped on us when it confused the audience. It should have spent 122 minutes getting this series back on track after the staggeringly bad choices of the 2012 debacle.It doesn't. There is simply no way a third prequel can logically tie into the Nostromo crew finding a thousands-year-long dead Space Jockey fossilized in the derelict on LV426. Ridley Scott has gone insane and doesn't know what he's doing.The original quadrilogy had the tangible DNA of four different directors upfront and visible in every frame, for better or worse.

69,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_19,"After the amazing Alien and Aliens, (and I believe the hard done by Alien 3), we had a string of utter tripe from this franchise, and this is no better. Character development is almost non existent, with the vast majority of people there simply to die. Danny Mcbride might as well have had a leash on him, for all the acting he was allowed to do, and James Franco showed more charisma than anyone else in the movie...and he died before even having a speaking role.The film has gone down this ancient feel/setting, which didn't work in AVP, or Prometheus, and just flat out bores to death in this film. And the ""twist"" at the end was so obvious that there was an audible ""DUH"" and ""NO SH*T"" from onlookers in the cinema during the reveal.Ridley Scott's last two films have led me to believe a couple of things.1. He can't do jack without a GREAT script 2. His movies look good, but are boring as hell 3. Alien was a fluke! It was a mess of ideas that all came together and somehow worked, but that was by accident and not design...or at least not by Scott's design.Unless Cameron, or possibly Blomkamp (hell even give David Fincher another go) get involved, or perhaps someone equally as talented, we're just going to see Ridley Scott spew his old man, self indulgent philosophical man juice all over our faces for the foreseeable future It was an OK by film standards...but by an Alien film standards it was pure muck.And a final note.

70,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_20,"I only recently got around to seeing 'Prometheus' and quite enjoyed it, without really loving it. Though for me to get any enjoyment out of a sci-fi film (my least favourite genre) is rare. So the fact that I had an enormously good time with 'Alien: Covenant' says a lot. This film was a lot of fun from start to finish.Firstly, the action really steps it up this time around. It is plentiful and brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott. The film moves at a break-neck speed and you've barely settled down from one action sequence before the next one is commencing. Also the aliens look absolutely terrific in this film, as does every CGI feature for that matter.Secondly, the characters are once again masterfully written. Michael Fassbender as 'David/Walter' is nothing short of captivating. The performances he gives as these characters deserve more recognition than I believe they will get. He's undoubtedly the stand-out, but there is not a weak link in the chain in this film.Finally, the overall plot line is quite brilliant. Less convoluted and confusing than 'Prometheus' (I didn't find it overly confusing, but I'm told some did), yet equally (if not more so) smart and intriguing. I love that this film has enough layers to it where not everything is always as it seems. In an action/horror movie those kind of elements can sometimes be put on the back burner, but not here.I would have to say I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to. It took me quite off guard with just how affecting it was able to be. The two hour run time absolutely flies by and the credits are rolling before you know it.

71,Alien_Covenant,Alien_Covenant_21,"The space ship and the alien world are portrayed beautifully in this movie. In that sense it's a beautiful movie. I wish Ridley would explore this further outside of the Aliens franchise.The ""aliens bursting out of the body"" theme -- the hallmark of this franchise, I suppose -- was done well in one spectacular scene. If you enjoy that kind of visceral, Cronenburg-esque horror, you won't be disappointed.Let me list the obvious problems....One problem is that the visuals are not that different from Prometheus. This movie is quite similar to Prometheus.A second problem is that there is no real intellectually interesting premise behind it all. No new story really. No character development at all this time, which is a huge problem. I don't like this special historical connection the aliens somehow have now with the human race via the Engineers. These Engineers. Who are they again?""Alien bursts out of body. Alien becomes scary and evil. Woman fights alien."" This is the plot of every movie. I'm tired of these aliens. A third, very annoying problem is that all the crew seem to be paired off with each other. This movie is proof that partnered people should not be in a military unit together, because if this movie is any indication, the minute one's partner is endangered or gets killed the screaming and blubbering and unprofessionalism begins. ""Oh my god, my wife might be in trouble, I will risk this huge space ship, and all 2000 colonists, just to save her. She's so important.""My response was: WTF is your wife/husband/partner doing on the ship with you if you're such an emotional mess? At one point, I yelled ""stop screaming"" aloud at the screen. This is why there are (or should be) rules about this kind of thing. Somehow the edginess of the marines in the first movie has morphed into this. I don't like it.A fourth problem, perhaps the most annoying problem of all, is that these people seem to have no understanding of the biological dangers of alien planets. I mean, a 10-year-old would know about this from watching cartoons. Why don't they? Why would you get so close to a man who was clearly suffering from some serious alien trauma? Why would you look into an alien pod knowing that the alien planet had somehow infected your mates? How can I rate a movie highly when I was spending much of it rolling my eyes?A fifth problem is that the David/Walter mix up was so frigging obvious. I saw it immediately. How could the crew not have checked this more carefully? It was just unbelievable that they didn't do this. And how did David learn Walter's codes? A sixth problem: the movie was confusing. I googled it afterwards to try to sort it out, but I still don't know how the alien got onto the colonist ship after all that effort to keep it out. I suppose David brought it in, but how? In his mouth? And what happened exactly when David brought the ship to this alien world. Where did he get those spores? What were they?

77,The_Shining,The_Shining_2,"The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's ""Here's Johnny!""? Who could forget ""All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy""? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny, and Jack's wife, Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication ""shining."" Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain ""shine"" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word ""redrum"" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own ""imaginary friend."" Jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" formatted in various ways. Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written ""REDRUM"" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is ""Murder"" spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. ""Here's Johnny!"", and Jack's legendary image is born.The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema.

78,The_Shining,The_Shining_3,"When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.",jack torrance nicholson offered job winter caretaker overlook hotel accepts opportunity work novel isolated environment told stories last caretaker going mad butchering family deterred arrives overlook hotel wife duvall child danny lloyd shown around hotel cook scatman crothers gift perception cook warns danny hotel particular danger gift matter time jack begins act increasingly jack nicholson finest roles increasingly unhinged character amusing terrifying almost equal measures duvall plays role terrorised wife quite well look like genuinely filled fear much else lloyd excellent boy although much emotion express however doubt jack story stick king novel better kubrick plenty genuinely scary moments manages keep creepy atmosphere especially ghosts come jack begins move reality reality gradually claiming excellent cold direction adds overall creep factor best examples masterful excellent focus fear rather gore alone modern horrors jack excellent best roles ever whole package delivered cold creepy manner sadly lost director,1,0.9796,positive
79,The_Shining,The_Shining_4,"Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress.

80,The_Shining,The_Shining_5,"This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?Ah well. ""What if""s never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery. The scenery's pretty good eye candy and, besides, he does it so well.",difficult review write see posted comments ella enchanted comment someone never read book absolutely fine difficult approach stanley kubrick basis see read stephen king absolute best put book mind suppose must acknowledged tolerable two major flaws overlong slow burn loaded increasing dread becomes simply boring two jack nicholson established screen persona means absolutely suspense development decent though flawed maniac final madness first frame appears never read book fan probably enjoy huge surprises ticks boxes looks missed opportunity stanley kubrick man goes mad haunted hotel stephen king novel evil entity inhabits hotel wants consume boy psychic power boy strong enough resist works weakest link father gradually erodes everything made good decent man jack transition decent though weak man starts point overlook control every action absolutely central stephen king could worked screen jack portrayed actor initially credible decent gentle man nicholson love view spectacular piece miscasting picture dustin hoffman harrison ford someone similar dramatic shocking descent maniachood would contrast essential stephen king story nicholson also worth commenting king man loves family kubrick stated screenwriter dvd documentaries man hates family fairly fundamental difference yes ah well never got us anywhere go see stanley kubrick anyway enjoy jack nicholson chewing scenery scenery pretty good eye candy besides well,1,0.9511,positive
81,The_Shining,The_Shining_6,"Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.  I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.
One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.').
The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.",okay okay maybe greatest mean exorcist psycho others hard pass way however far best stephen king story made better stand better pet sematary quite scary better cujo better green mile better dolores claiborne better stand barely though yes better shawshank redemption shut better care imdb top says read couple decades ago stanley kubrick sorting novels home trying find might make good room wife would hear pounding noise every half hour threw books wall frustration finally hear noise almost two hours went check see died chair something tell due respect course found concentrating book hand book thank god went convert book best king thanked complexity story man takes wife son remote hotel oversee extremely isolated winter works writing jack nicholson thanked performance jack torrance many movies jack plays character named jack well flawless delivery several lines heeeeeere johnny shelley duvall thanked giving performance allows audience relate jack desires kill stanley kubrick thanked giving excellent story recognizable touch whoever casting director thanked scrounging creepiest twins planet play part murdered girls significant aspects necessary story whole significant effect isolation presents flawlessly starts lengthy scene following jack drives old hotel interview job caretaker winter soon followed following jack family drive windy mountain road hotel time scene intermixed shots jack wendy danny talking car kubrick managed sneak quick suggestion evils tv wendy voices concern talking cannibalism front danny says okay already seen tv see okay saw hotel perfect setting story like take bloody past made much frightening huge echoing rooms long hallways rooms echoes constantly emphasize emptiness hotel hallways really created scariness kubrick traditional tracking shots give hallways creepy feel early famous tracking shot follows danny large circle rides around halls big wheel called relative speed well clunking made wheels goes back forth hardwood floors throw rugs gives feeling knowing around corner stephen king story expect something jump think best scene halls well scariest danny playing floor ball rolls slowly looks sees long empty hallway ball something child toy expect must horrendously creepy twins rolled anyway get point damn scary rare quality suck depth story really keeps guessing leaves feeling something missed jack always like grady told men room really ball someone looks exactly like always caretaker grady also said mean went crazy killed wife twin daughters grady leave loose ends tied mediocre filmmaking example amityville obviously copied much far subject matter entirely different presented way really makes think mostly kubrick movies thank stanley kubrick thank throwing book wall toss would cinematic tragedy,3,0.9974,positive

83,The_Shining,The_Shining_8,"Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great.

86,The_Shining,The_Shining_11,"It's well know that Stephen King doesn't like Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining (so much so that he scripted an abysmal TV movie version). According to him, Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well, I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions, cheap tricks and tired clichés. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words, it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot  as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well, can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bug-eyed, bucktoothed Olive Oil look-a-like.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel, he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked - he's got to spend months alone with these people; one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there. It merely brings everything to the surface  Jack's resentment as regards his wife, his frustration as regards his lack of writing talent and his annoyance at having a troubled son. It's kind of like he's testing his family. Are they strong enough as a unit to survive being cooped up together?One of the underlying themes in the film seems to be television. What happens in The Shining is what happens when someone stops watching the idiot box. With it, a person can find solace in mindless programming and retreat from the strictures of family life. Without it they're faced with all their problems and all the failings of their loved ones. Even the strongest family can be brought to its knees when there's no escape from each other's company. Therefore it's quite telling, when Jack loses the plot completely, that he spouts lines from TV: ""Honey, I'm home"" and ""Here's Johnny."" Just watch some television, Jack.But it's also the pain of writing that contributes to Jack's insanity. There's nothing quite as harrowing as an empty page. Plus there's nothing more annoying than being interrupted mid-flow. One of the best scenes in the film is when Jack tells his wife to get lost when she interrupts him. It's extremely violent in how cold Jack is towards Wendy. And because it's grounded in a reality, it's all the more effective.Also rather unsettling is the scene where Jack talks to his son. He makes Danny sit on his lap and he proceeds to tell him how much he loves him and how he'd never hurt him. It works so well because it's so cold and because there's such an obvious lack of affection. The words are just empty platitudes. They mean absolutely nothing.Jack's true feelings are only revealed when he gets to talk to Lloyd. It's in this scene that you realise the marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be  Wendy has never forgiven him for accidentally hurting his son. And it's also in this scene that you realise (as if you hadn't noticed earlier) that Jack is absolutely crackers. He's talking to ghosts. But they could also be figments of his imagination, for there are mirrors behind most of the ghosts he talks to. Effectively he's talking to himself. And I love this matter of fact way of dealing with the supernatural. There are no fancy tricks. Everything just seems unnaturally natural.In fact, everything to do with the ghosts is superbly handled. The twins are spooky, Lloyd is amiable and Grady is out of his mind. And it's Grady who's probably the most chilling presence in the film. He starts off as a bumbling waiter but then quickly becomes a stone cold killer. Just the way he says 'corrected' conveys more terror than a million slasher films. And Philip Stone's performance is a million times more subtle than Nicholson's. I mean, as much as I like Jack in the film, he does chew the scenery. But Kubrick likes his over the top performances, so that's the way he wanted it.And undoubtedly it's Kubrick's movie. He's the real star. And I love everything he brings to the film. I love his command of lighting  just look at The Gold Room scenes. I love his use of music. I love the way that he turns the Room 237 scene, one that could have been a standard 'jump' scene, into a comment on Jack's marriage  his willingness to be unfaithful. I love the way that he leaves lots of unanswered questions. I love the shots of the blood coming out of the lift. I love the helicopter shots at the start. I love the way that pages and pages of typed words are the most frightening visual in the film. I love the maze. I love the fact that you see a ghost getting a blow-job from a ghost in a bear suit Man, I love absolutely everything about this film. It's horror for people who know that true horror isn't being stalked by a man in a mask, but being trapped alone with your family.",well know stephen king like stanley kubrick version much scripted abysmal tv version according kubrick understand genre well think kubrick think understood well knew genre full conventions cheap tricks tired cliches therefore kubrick decided throw nonsense window make based atmosphere rather predictable thrills get people jumping dark time time get worthless shocks kubrick version insidious gets skin words pavlovian dogs spent lifetime conditioned cretinous runs deepest frustration family right beginning obvious jack happy lot shown around hotel help take sneaky look backsides couple women well blame poor man married bucktoothed olive oil jack frustration son danny driving hotel bothered requests food son makes knowledgeable saw programme tv already slightly irked got spend months alone people resembles popeye missus talks really hotel brings nothing already merely brings everything surface jack resentment regards wife frustration regards lack writing talent annoyance troubled son kind like testing family strong enough unit survive cooped together underlying themes seems television happens happens someone stops watching idiot box person find solace mindless programming retreat strictures family life without faced problems failings loved ones even strongest family brought knees escape company therefore quite telling jack loses plot completely spouts lines tv honey home johnny watch television also pain writing contributes jack insanity nothing quite harrowing empty page plus nothing annoying interrupted best scenes jack tells wife get lost interrupts extremely violent cold jack towards wendy grounded reality rather unsettling scene jack talks son makes danny sit lap proceeds tell much loves would never hurt works well cold obvious lack affection words empty platitudes mean absolutely true feelings revealed gets talk lloyd scene realise marriage cracked wendy never forgiven accidentally hurting son also scene realise noticed earlier jack absolutely crackers talking ghosts could also figments imagination mirrors behind ghosts talks effectively talking love matter fact way dealing supernatural fancy tricks everything seems unnaturally fact everything ghosts superbly handled twins spooky lloyd amiable grady mind grady probably chilling presence starts bumbling waiter quickly becomes stone cold killer way says conveys terror million slasher philip stone performance million times subtle nicholson mean much like jack chew scenery kubrick likes top performances way wanted undoubtedly kubrick real star love everything brings love command lighting look gold room scenes love use music love way turns room scene could standard scene comment jack marriage willingness unfaithful love way leaves lots unanswered questions love shots blood coming lift love helicopter shots start love way pages pages typed words frightening visual love maze love fact see ghost getting ghost bear suit man love absolutely everything people know true stalked man mask trapped alone family,3,0.9945,positive
87,The_Shining,The_Shining_12,"Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that?

88,The_Shining,The_Shining_13,"When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since.

89,The_Shining,The_Shining_14,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10",never big fan movies usually try cheap tricks scare audiences like loud noises creepy children usually lack originality contain overacting galore like stir echoes kevin bacon great story joined maybe even surpassed stanley kubrick quite possibly scariest follows writer jack nicholson family agree watch hotel closed winter rumors haunted last resident went crazy murdered family jack convinced ok use overcome writer block months solitude silence however jack becomes grumpy later violent cabin fever something hotel driving mad creepiest parts feeling isolation kubrick makes hotel silent rooms huge yet always empty also eerily calm jack son riding bike barren hallways jack nicholson performance also best scaring hell making sure get awhile favorite scene talking ghost inside tops movies opinion beating snot crap like ring blair witch project may oldie definitely goodie,1,-0.7237,negative
90,The_Shining,The_Shining_15,"This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.6/10 stars, and that is being generous.",got overrated history watched first time expecting best best quite letdown sets music great course kubrick seems forgotten important make horrifying likable characters way bad things start happening audience feels however documentary dysfunctional family world supposed loving husband father goes insane jack nicholson brilliant portraying total insanity gradual shift looks like snap scene wife whimpering nervous wreck seem trust point throughout kid danny weird little nut identify people another major problem clear storyline whole first half kid psychic abilities total switch focuses jack nicholson crazy point spending time danny seems like foreshadowing something never amounts anything guess danny first see ghosts house big enough plot point spend entire first half incredibly creepy music sets nothing really scary fun see jack nicholson ham course scariness involved spend entire waiting listlessly pick ax rather shocked goes lovable psychotic instead goes psychotic extremely stars generous,1,0.9624,positive
91,The_Shining,The_Shining_16,"I can't praise this film long enough!The Shining is, without doubt, one of Stanley Kubrick's undisputed masterpieces and a true classic in horror cinema. It is a film that, over the course of the years, has managed to scare the living hell out of its audiences (and still does). The film is an adaptation of Stepehen King's original novel, written in the late '70s, and although the film is not very loyal to the book, it still stands as a thing of its own.Right from the beginning, as we contemplate the car going to the hotel from those stunning aerial shots, deeply inside us we know that something in the film, somehow, sometime is going to go wrong. As we obtain that severe warning, an almost inaudible voice gently whispers to us 'sit tight', a sense of unexpectedness invades us all, and it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand on end throughout out the entire movie.
The plot is simple: Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in up in the secluded mountains of Colorado. Jack, being a family man, takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel to keep him company throughout the long, isolated nights. During their stay, strange things occur when Jack's son Danny sees gruesome images powered by a force called 'the shining' and Jack is heavily affected by this. Along with writer's block and the demons of the hotel haunting him, Jack has a complete mental breakdown and the situation takes a sinister turn for the worse.The film, unlike many horror-oriented films nowadays, doesn't only rely on stomach-churning and gory images (which it does contain, anyway) but on the incredibly scary music based on the works of Béla Bartók and on the excellent cinematography (the Steadicam is superbly used, giving us a sense of ever-following evil), as well. The terrifying mood and atmosphere of the film is carefully and masterfully woven by Kubrick, who clearly knows how to really make a horror movie.Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as the mad father and husband is as over the top as it is brilliant. Shelley Duvall, who plays the worrying wife who tries to help her son, is also a stand out; she shows a kind of trembling fear in many scenes and is able to display weakness and vulnerability in a very convincing way. Undoubtedly, The Shining is full of memorable moments (the elevator scene or the 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' one-liner for instance) and, simply put, it's flawlessly brilliant.Stanley Kubrick's direction is pure excellence, giving the whole film a cold and atmospheric look, thus creating an unbearable sense of paranoia and terror. There are moments of sheer brilliance and exquisite perfection in this film; the horrifying maze chase is a perfect example. Every single shot is masterfully created and there are some genuinely scary scenes which will make you sit on the edge of your seat.The Shining is, in my opinion, a special landmark in horror cinema which will always be regarded as one of the scariest movies in film history. Since I saw it last year, when I was 13, I have rarely been able to have a bath in my bathtub.Just in case, ya know. Overall, The Shining is incomparably the scariest film I've ever seen in my whole life (and I can tell you I've seen a great deal of horror films).It is an unforgettable, chilling, majestic and truly, profoundly scary film crafted by an eccentric genius who wants to show that the impossible can be done.

92,The_Shining,The_Shining_17,"Kubrick spent his 40+ year career proving that no matter what the genre he will, not only do it well, but will dominate it. The Shining is no exception. A filmed nightmare, it's a naturalistically still and insistently surreal mixture of thick mood and rich story. A maze of surprises even after multiple viewings, its terror hovers right under the surface before exploding onto our brains. A masterpiece of hypnotic horror that's as insidiously, mind-bogglingly creepy as ever. At the center is the ever-menacing presence of Nicholson. Presenting a sobering lesson in how to not be a husband / father (and not just because of the violent climax), his dementia begins unraveling from moment one. Despite his iconically villainous turn, I'm not sure he's even the best of the bunch. Crothers brings beautiful lightness when needed, and his darker moments that much more powerful; and Lloyd walks a brilliant tightrope between creepy-horror-kid, average boyhood, and haunting sadness. Above all, Duvall's compelling and deeply broken turn as forlorn wife / mother is beyond perfect. These performers are given a directorial assuredness to play in rarely matched outside of Kubrick. The plight of these characters is captured with such empathy, we're given a personal view of what could easily have been a cold experience. Every detail is so intentionally and perfectly placed to draw us into the growing madness of the Overlook Hotel: The blood-flood, the dead-eyed stares, the symmetry of the twins, the normally-calm camera ferociously following the swinging axe.

94,The_Shining,The_Shining_19,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10",chilling majestic piece cinematic fright combines great elements intellectual thriller grand vision director instinctual capacity pace moody flick within realm filmmaking genius includes eye original shot soundtrack overall sense dehumanization cuts typical movies like human eye allows viewer feel violence psychosis protagonist appreciate seed derangement stems scariest things people face unknown presents plotting thought mind setting perfect desolate winter hideaway quietness moment character fermenting aggressor jack torrance mind wallows idle time breeds devil new playground always felt like presence evil dormant minds circumstances moment reasons given therein needed wake violent ass pounce unsuspecting victims perfect example within subtle touches canvas young boy big wheel riding along empty hallways hotel labyrinthian garden representing mind fine line sane insane kubrick purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors set discover world guided righteous tangible coaxed away powerful unknown never read book upon based without comparison point proud say terrifying ever seen thought runtime could cut little bit acclaimed directors history maybe keep criticisms superb captures attention grand form vision ropes terror eccentric direction ties stabs heart view man mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere loss,2,0.7812,positive

96,The_Shining,The_Shining_21,"The Shining is directed by Stanley Kubrick and is a horror movie based on the novel by Steven King. In reviewing this film, there's probably nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. This movie has stood the test of time and will forever be praised as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. From the production design, to the performances, the movie is unmatched. The atmosphere Kubrick creates in The Shining is in my opinion, the reason why this movie has suck around as long as it has. The Overlook Hotel is a character in itself. The way the music in the opening credits establishes the feeling of this setting whilst the camera travels through nature leading to to hotel, just instantly impacts the audience, immediately immersing them into the world. Once you enter the hotel, you feel as though you are really there living through the characters. Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance is beyond perfect. He presents the slow progression of insanity so authentically, which ultimately leads to one of the most iconic climaxes of all time. His wife played my Shelley Duvall does an amazing job with a performance so over the top is actually works. The son, Danny Torrance is probably my favourite character in the movie. He easily could have ruined the film but he does a fantastic job in delivering some absurd lines which I still genuinely get so creeped out by. The Shining is a film lovers dream. And whilst Steven king didn't like the film, how can one not marvel at all the symmetry, vibrant colour palette and perfect set design. Seriously I know the Overlook Hotel is haunted, but I would check into that place any day. To walk through the ballroom, see the iconic carpet and use that unusually modern red bathroom would be a dream. The Shining is one of my favourites movies ever.

97,The_Shining,The_Shining_22,"The Shining (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a writer who agrees to overlook a hotel in Colorado during the winter months when it's closed down. His son has an imaginary friend that helps him see things. When the family arrives at the hotel he tries to warn the family something is off but they feel it's just him adjusting. The hotel brings lies and secrets about the family to the surface. When a snowstorm hits the hotel that won't let anyone in or out the families hope for surviving the winter diminishes.This movie is directed by icon Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange) and stars Jack Nicholson (Chinatown), Shelley Duvall (Popeye), Danny Lloyd (Doctor Sleep), Scatman Crothers (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and Joe Turkel (Bladerunner).The cinematography and soundtrack for this is legendary. The ability to capture the daunting landscape of the circumstances and portray the intensity of the isolation with background music is magnificent. The acting is out of this world and Nicholson, Duvall and Lloyd deliver all time great performances. Nicholson's evolution as a character is perfectly portrayed. Kubrick had to be very clever with the times and how he portrayed Nicholsons childhood abuses as well as how Nicholson was sexually abusing Danny. It's very subtle but smart simultaneously. There will never be a time that the talking finger and blood elevator isn't creepy and the use of redrum will be a catch phrase for eternity. Every second of this movie is a masterpiece but the last 20 minutes will go down as one of the best finales to any movie ever, in and out of the horror genre.Overall, this is an all time great movie of any genre. Kubrick really put everything into this picture, more than the audience can even capture with the imagination. A true masterpiece and a must see.

98,The_Shining,The_Shining_23,"*!!- SPOILERS - !!*Before I begin this, let me say that I have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the ""Authorized Version"" of this movie, remade by Stephen King, himself, in 1997.Both advantages made me appreciate this version of ""The Shining,"" all the more.Also, let me say that I've read Mr. King's book, ""The Shining"" on many occasions over the years, and while I love the book and am a huge fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling ... and SCARY.Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film.  In the direction of the movie AND the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title ""Magus"" beyond question. Kubrick's genius is like magic.  The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999.  Among his other outstanding credits are:  Eyes Wide Shut, 1999;  Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more.The Torrences (Jack, Wendy his wife and Danny, their son) are living in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been hired as the caretaker.  It is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the Overlook reopens its doors.  It seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the Colorado Mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging.  It lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time ""welcoming"" atmosphere, itself.  The furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach to the Overlook,  it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world.The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius.  You get the whole story of their past, Danny's ""imaginary friend,"" Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene.  There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning.Closing Day.  Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the Hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.The initial tour through the Overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the ""staff"" is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. ""They did a good job!  Pink and gold are my favorite colors."" (Wendy Torrence)  Even the ""staff wing"" is well designed and beautifully built.The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian.  When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting.  ""I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out."" (The Hotel Manager)Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance.  His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful.  You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with Wendy and ""Doc.""  His explanation of ""the shining"" to Danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel.  It was believable and sincere.The cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie.  It also marks the ""half-way-to-hell"" point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful.  (So WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?!  It just shows her marvelous diversity!)  Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said,"" What?  Olive Oyl?  *lol*  (Popeye was also released in 1980.)  But I took that back as soon as the movie started.  She's brilliant.   In this Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date!  (Although I did love her in Steve Martin's ""Roxanne,"" 1987.)Once Kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession:  the Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony;  the history of the Hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not ""mental,"" but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the Hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.The two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times to Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time.  They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father.  He was...""the little boy who lives in my mouth.""  He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny.  NOT like in the book, I realize, where Tony was intended by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father.  Kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when Tony ""took ... Danny ... over.""  The idea of Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.The ""Woman in the Shower"" scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting.  It was dramatic, and frightening.  Abhorrent and scary.  When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.Jack quickly embarks on his trek from  the ""jonesing"" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person.  The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ...""hair of the dog that bit me."" (Jack Torrence)  In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack.  ""Orders from the house.""  (Lloyd the Bartender)  Nice play on words.When Wendy find's Jack's ""screenplay"" is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, ""How do you like it?"" and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant.  It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence.  That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly THE strongest scene of the movie.The ""REDRUM"" scene.  Wow.  What do I say?  What mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming ""REDRUM"" over and over?  Even if it HAD no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL.  It was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed).  Speaking of memorable scenes...Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history.  His ad-libbed line, ""Heeeeere's Johnny!"" was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror.  It also goes down in horror movie history.The ending..?  Kubrick's ending was perfection.  I felt it ended beautifully.  No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie.  Just epitomized perfection.  That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending.Who cares what was taken out?!  Look what Kubrick put IN.  Rent it, watch it, BUY IT.  It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason.  IT RAWKS!!*Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 ""Authorized"" version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section.

99,The_Shining,The_Shining_24,"I shall never, ever be able to understand the phenomenon known as Stanley Kubrick. When he was on, as with DR STRANGELOVE, he was brilliant. But when he was bad, he was awful.I saw THE SHINING in its first release in a packed movie house in New York City. I had read and loved Stephen King's novel; I am widely read in the horror genre and do not scare easily, but that book gave me the creeps for weeks.Well, for all the people who have been raving what a masterpiece this film is, I can only tell you this. The crowd in the theatre started giggling the minute Jack Nicholson appeared on film, and by the time he chased Shelley Duvall up the stairs, the whole crowd was literally in stitches. And I was laughing right along with them. Maybe New York audiences are just jaded; I don't know.Not that this movie does not have some scary moments. Shelley Duvall is rather good when she is away from Nicholson and it starts to dawn on her that something evil is taking over her family and her life. Unfortunately, Miss Duvall plays Wendy Torrance, a strong, intelligent, and resourceful woman in the novel, as a pathetic, whiny ninny most of the time, and by the time Nicholson had her trapped in the bathroom, I am sure plenty of us were screaming for her head. It must be said that this is not the fault of Miss Duvall, a talented and intelligent actress who according to reports fought bitterly with Kubrick over his interpretation of Wendy.The kid talking to his finger is another idiotic and unintentionally hilarious bit of business that was not in the original novel. Why Kubrick thought this was a good idea is beyond me.But let's get down to the real problem: Jack Nicholson. In the right role, he can be very good, though he has never been among my top ten. Jack Torrance is totally the wrong role for him; for one thing, he does not look ordinary enough. But the worst thing is that Stephen King's story was about a man being SLOWLY AND INEXORABLY driven out of his mind. Nicholson goes nuts so early in the film that there is literally nowhere for him to take the character. And Kubrick was either in awe of Nicholson, who was still riding the post-Oscar high from CUCKOO'S NEST, or he just didn't care, or he thought it was scary when it was actually funny. I don't know.As if all this were not bad enough, the whole mess drags on for two hours and twenty-two minutes; this movie practically cries out for a pair of scissors.Some people will feel that I have spat on an icon, I suppose, and they have that right. But Stephen King himself was not happy with this film, and when he finally got the opportunity to re-do it as a television miniseries in 1997, the results were much better. For the one thing that is missing in Kubrick's version is a heart.Anne Rivers Siddons, in discussing her excellent horror novel THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR, writes that the thing about horror is that it smashes people and relationships. Thus the best horror stories are at bottom also very sad (Brian De Palma's CARRIE gets this; Kubrick's film does not). And whatever your feelings about the miniseries format may be, the Torrance family created in 1997 were people you could care about. Director Mick Garris understands King better than Kubrick did, and Rebecca De Mornay, in particular, redeems the Wendy character in a spectacular tour-de-force towards the end. In 1980 the Torrances were figures of fun. Rather like the barbaric Victorian custom of laughing at the lunatics in Bedlam.Awful, awful, awful.",shall never ever able understand phenomenon known stanley kubrick dr strangelove brilliant bad saw first release packed house new york city read loved stephen king novel widely read genre scare easily book gave creeps people raving masterpiece tell crowd theatre started giggling minute jack nicholson appeared time chased shelley duvall stairs whole crowd literally stitches laughing right along maybe new york audiences jaded scary moments shelley duvall rather good away nicholson starts dawn something evil taking family life unfortunately miss duvall plays wendy torrance strong intelligent resourceful woman novel pathetic whiny ninny time time nicholson trapped bathroom sure plenty us screaming head must said fault miss duvall talented intelligent actress according reports fought bitterly kubrick interpretation kid talking finger another idiotic unintentionally hilarious bit business original novel kubrick thought good idea beyond let us get real problem jack nicholson right role good though never among top ten jack torrance totally wrong role look ordinary enough worst stephen king story man slowly inexorably driven mind nicholson goes nuts early literally nowhere take character kubrick either awe nicholson still riding high cuckoo nest care thought scary actually funny bad enough whole mess drags two hours minutes practically cries pair people feel spat icon suppose right stephen king happy finally got opportunity television miniseries results much better missing kubrick version rivers siddons discussing excellent novel house next door writes smashes people relationships thus best stories bottom also sad brian de palma carrie gets kubrick whatever feelings miniseries format may torrance family created people could care director mick garris understands king better kubrick rebecca de mornay particular redeems wendy character spectacular towards end torrances figures fun rather like barbaric victorian custom laughing lunatics awful awful,1,0.9828,positive
